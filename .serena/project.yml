  This is the crlEPH-dlc project: a Julia-based implementation of the Emergent Perceptual Haze (EPH)
  framework for swarm intelligence research. The project uses Active Inference and Free Energy Principle
  to guide multi-agent behavior through spatial precision modulation (Haze).

  Key points:
  - Main implementation: Julia (src_julia/)
  - Visualization: Python with Pygame (viewer.py)
  - Communication: ZeroMQ (Julia server → Python client)
  - Core concepts: SPM (Saliency Polar Map), EPH (Haze-modulated precision), Stigmergy

  Please refer to CLAUDE.md for comprehensive development guidance.
